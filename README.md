# Distributed Internet Traffic Generator

This project aimed at creating an android version of DITG software. The android libs can be thought as a wrapper for the compiled DITG version in the android environment.
Since the actual status doesn't support the newest android versions, the android libs should be updated. The DITG compilation should not be changed in most of the cases.
